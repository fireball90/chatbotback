"United Call Centers has pioneered the at-home model, integrating home working into a customer support environment, as our team has been using this system for certain types of work since 2008. Today, this way of working is a key element of our operations, as this modern, cloud-based system allows us to have staff located anywhere in the world, making it much easier to serve exotic languages or special needs and speeding up the implementation of new collaborations. Besides our main activities, we are also involved in the development of next-generation IT and communication services, chatbots, automation tools, staffing services.Over two decades, we have worked with major clients worldwide in telecommunications, tourism, food, energy, healthcare, automotive, financial services, and entertainment, however, this list can be extended to include any industry that requires communication with one's partners or clients. That's our reason to strive for the best every day of the year. Our goal is to represent our clients with complete credibility, providing world-class call center and contact center services to our customers, every time they contact us. We offer our partners the professionalism and technological infrastructure of the industry's leading players, with on-demand services based on individual needs, always with priority client attention.United Call Centers is committed to corporate social responsibility and everyday environmental awareness. As we build trust between our customers and clients as a contact center, we also work in other areas to make the world a better place, every day. We constantly support charitable initiatives and regularly engage in activities to raise awareness of sustainability and individual responsibility.Following the previously announced REbot Plastic-Free July as an internal team-building challenge, United Call Centers has developed a special chatbot-based gamification platform to motivate the community to lead a waste-free and eco-conscious lifestyle on a daily basis. By completing simple tasks, participants can contribute to a greener everyday life, from buying plastic-free groceries to recommending packaging-free shops, taking action on litter picking or registering illegal landfills they find. The platform is currently available in three languages - English, German and Hungarian - and regular campaigns and prizes are offered to encourage activity.Seasonal campaigns are not the only way to promote environmental awareness. Our efforts towards social responsibility can be successful if we make health and environmental awareness an everyday reality for our colleagues so that we can work together for good causes through collective effort, dedication, and leading by example while inspiring others.In the autumn of 2019, we added 80 new bicycles to the United Call Centers fleet, which not only help us to get around without emitting harmful emissions but also contribute to the health of our employees. Our aim is to provide a comfortable and environmentally friendly alternative for those who want to work in an office environment from time to time, in addition to the at-home model. Of course, UCC Bikes can also be used for private purposes, hiking tours with the family, shopping, or anything else.Work-life balance and the quality of life of our staff are a priority for us. As a family-friendly workplace, we provide ongoing opportunities for flexible working arrangements and scheduling. We offer our employees professional and soft-skills trainings, and we regularly encourage them to exercise and to join charity programs, whether it's blood donation, fundraising or reducing plastic pollution.United Call Centers is committed to corporate social responsibility and everyday environmental awareness.

(Ltd) to help emphasize our human values and facilitate collaborations.UCC is a call center provider company, it has been working for decades on creating a team which can effectively and assertively communicate with the highest level of professionalism with management, colleagues, and first of all customers.By introducing our Code of Conduct we would like to set behaviour examples for employees which they can use in their customer relationships, helping quality work and strengthening loyalty.The current Code of Conduct contains basic guidelines applicable to all employees of United Call Centers Kft. (Ltd), including management and owners.One of the fundamental cornerstones of a successful contact center is the sales-focused attitude. We support our clients' sales activities at every possible channel and level of transaction, whether it's product and service awareness, needs assessment, lead generation, or sales in the traditional sense of the word. Our highly trained staff can communicate in potentially any language in the world, while also fully identifying with our partner's values and policies, leaving no language or geographical barriers to our results.We continuously improve our sales processes in close cooperation with our clients. Our team is supported by top-quality technology infrastructure to help us contribute to the success of our partners with a cutting-edge customer experience and with hundreds of thousands of successful transactions every year!The human voice is still the most important way to communicate. A sympathetic sales agent is much more effective in building trust with the customer than an often unread, impersonal promotional letter or e-mail. An expert customer service team is crucial in communicating with our customers, finding new clients and markets, but can also support any upselling or cross-selling activity.Telemarketing outsourcing is also a very cost-effective solution in general, but it is particularly recommended for clients who regularly need to communicate seasonal promotions, products, and sales with fluctuating contact numbers. A sales-focused contact center can find excellent sales opportunities whenever the agent contacts a customer, as it is much easier to raise awareness of our client's new products and services if they have already shown interest - even if they originally contacted us for a different reason.Finding potentially interested partners is one of the hardest parts of sales. Make your sales team's job easier by letting trained, experienced, and professional agents handle the cold calling, needs assessment, and pre-arranging appointments in person or online. We offer lead generation campaigns to our clients, such as the complexity of the field, the need for specific knowledge, or those who want to contact their prospects directly for whatever reason.We don't sell specific products and services, but rather we raise the interest of the potential target audience, assess the market, identify potential client needs and then agree on contact details and a time to make contact. With an adequate team of contact center staff, large monotonous tasks requiring administration can be completed in a matter of days. While the time and energy saved by using a contact center can be used to maintain quality contacts.There are no sales without an up-to-date database! Leave it to us to map potential buyers and customers, while building and updating the necessary databases. Data matching and questionnaire filling are done with a large team of administrators using the latest automation tools. A huge amount of information can be processed, while customer needs and potential sales opportunities can be mapped. This allows our clients to search for prospective and current clients on the basis of the most up-to-date data, and to concentrate on day-to-day tasks, where their presence is essential.Do you run a webshop where you have a lot of customer questions to answer every day? Leave your everyday customer service tasks in the hands of professionals!

A highly trained contact centre operator with professional communication skills can perform the same tasks as our client's employees, be it customer service, complaints handling, administrative os sales tasks.

Our agent profile-based call routing system ensures that your customers' queries are always answered by the operator with the most expertise in the area.There is no customer service without technology.
